######
Currently, structure supports both declaration and definition.
But, function supports only definition.
Later, maybe I will support function declaration.

######
when it comes to:
ExtDef-->Specifier SEMI
it can only be:
	Specifier-->StructSpecifier
	can not be: Specifier-->TYPE (since int; is meaningless)
and it can only be:
	StructSpecifier-->STRUCT OptTag LC DefList RC
	can not be: StructSpecifier-->STRUCT Tag(ID), since struct a; is meaningiless

#####
StructSpecifier-->STRUCT Tag: a struct declaration, and must followed by a param
StructSpecifier-->STRUCT OptTag LC DefList RC: a struct definition

#####
!Important
Some functions need to be independent from the kind of components they are dealing with. For example, VarDec() may be used by many syntax generators and the parameters of VarDec() should not include the param like func or struct etc.

Function Lists:
VarDec()
DefList()
